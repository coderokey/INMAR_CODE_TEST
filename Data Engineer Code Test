 Instructions
 This task is meant to get an understanding of your SQL skills. Our preference is for you to use
 the GoogleSQL dialect to complete this task, although not required. We will accept any SQL
 dialect. The solution should be posted to a public GitHub repository owned by you. Please
 commit directly to the master branch. Commits can be made as often as needed. When
 complete, share a link to your repository with your recruiter.
 Background
 Wehave a table in a BigQuery dataset that contains coupon redemption data. Every time a
 coupon is redeemed by a consumer, a record is inserted into this table. Each record is
 associated with a specific retailer and redemption date. Sometimes data is delayed getting
 inserted into this table and, on occasion, no records get inserted for a retailer for one or more
 days.
 There is a separate process that runs daily against this table that rolls up the number of
 coupons redeemed per day, by retailer, for the past 7 days. This data is inserted into the
 reporting dataset in a table called tblRedemptions-ByDay. No data is purged from this
 table.
 Data
 The following tables and data are available to you. Optional: If you have access to BigQuery
 and would like to create physical tables, the syntax is provided at the end of this document.

Task
 Write a query to pull back the most recent redemption count, by redemption date, for the date
 range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store". Your result should have 2 columns
 and 7 rows (one row per day in the date range). Provide the query and then using your query
 result, provide answers to the following questions.
 Questions
 Using the data set you produced from your query, answer the following questions:
 1. Which date had the least number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?
 2. Which date had the most number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?
 3. What was the createDateTime for each redemptionCount in questions 1 and 2?
 4. Is there another method you can use to pull back the most recent redemption count, by
 redemption date, for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store"?
 In words, describe how you would do this (no need to write a query, unless youâ€™d like to).
 Table Syntax (Optional)
 If you have access to BigQuery, you can create the tables mentioned above using the below
 syntax. Replace the [project] and [dataset] with your own project name and dataset
 name.
